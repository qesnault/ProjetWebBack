                <p>This website have been done by:</p>
                <ul>
                	<li>Quentin Esnault</li>
                	<li>Nicolas Ducarton</li>

                <h1>The work we've done</h1>
                <p>We have made the website following the subject at <a href="https://gregwar.com/s3web/project.html#title.1">this adress</a>.</p>
                <p>We have made the navigation bar with a search form, a page where you can see the series, navigate throught seasons and episodes, a login and register system with admins and regular users, and series rating.</p>
                <p>Globally, our website covers pratically all the subject, exept for the "adding new series" function that is not finished, because we do not import youtube trailers for exemple.</p>
                <p>Also, sorting series by their medium rate is not quite done yet.</p>

                <h1>What was difficult</h1>
                <p>For each of us there was some difficulties, related with the project or with the discovering of a new technology</p>
                <h2>For Quentin</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>One thing that was a little bit hard was to understand the symfony mvc system</li>
                <li>The way entities, views and controllers works was disturbing at first</li>
                <li>The lack of internet resources was a constraint too...</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h2>For Nicolas</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>It was hard because it is the first time I use a framework, and the concept of views and controllers was a little bit hard ton understand, especially when it comes to make them communicate.</li>
                <li>Plus, the TD's do not cover all the subject of the project, so some part of the project were "write code and try"</li>

                </ul>
